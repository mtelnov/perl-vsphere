                           VMware::vSphere

  WHAT IS IT?
  -----------

VMware::vSphere is a pure perl interface to VMware vSphere Web Services
(management interface for VMware vCenter and VMware ESXi products).
It is not a full-featured replacement for VMware vSphere Perl SDK but this
module has following advantages:

  * It's a pure perl module (VMware SDK has binaries and python (OMG!) in the
    latest distributive).

  * It has minumal dependencies on non-core modules. Actually it needs LWP,
    IO::Socket::SSL, XML::Simple and XML::Writer modules only.

  * High performance: it requests only what's actually needed.

The distribution includes:

  * VMware::vSphere - raw perl interface to VMware vSphere Web Services

  * VMware::vSphere::Simple - extends VMware::vSphere with simplified methods

  * vsphere - utility to call VMware::vSphere::Simple methods from CLI
